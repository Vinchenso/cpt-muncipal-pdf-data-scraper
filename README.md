# cpt-muncipal-pdf-data-scraper
Automates the gathering of all data from Cape Town Municpal PDFs

## Based on the following tutorials:

- [Scraping PDF Files using Ruby](http://www.thewanderingconsultant.com/scraping-pdf-files-using-ruby/)

## No longer required
Made use of Docparser to scrap the data from the pdfs.

## Notes

Docparser costs $19 per month, which is not worth it for roughly 25 Invoices a month.
Unless I can monetise my spare capacity, my assistant will continue to capture these pdfs
